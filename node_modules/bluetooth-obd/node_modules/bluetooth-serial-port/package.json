The goal is have an easy to use API. This module is great for communicating with Bluetooth enabled Arduino devices.\n\nIf you have any problems make sure to [checkout the FAQ](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port/issues?q=label%3AFAQ).\n\n## New in this release\n\n* Fixes a critical [runtime error](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port/issues/83) on all platforms.\n* Improves travis build.\n\n## Pre-requests on Linux\n\n* Needs Bluetooth development packages to build\n\n`apt-get install build-essential libbluetooth-dev`\n\n## Pre-request on OS X\n\n* Needs XCode and XCode command line tools installed.\n\n## Pre-request on Windows\n\n* Needs Visual Studio (Visual C++) and its command line tools installed.\n* Needs Python 2.x installed and accessible from the command line path.\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install bluetooth-serial-port`\n\n## Test build Linux using docker\n\n`docker build -t bluetooth-serial-port .`\n\n# Documentation\n\n## Basic usage\n\n```javascript\n\nvar btSerial = new (require('bluetooth-serial-port')).BluetoothSerialPort();\n\nbtSerial.on('found', function(address, name) {\n\tbtSerial.findSerialPortChannel(address, function(channel) {\n\t\tbtSerial.connect(address, channel, function() {\n\t\t\tconsole.log('connected');\n\n\t\t\tbtSerial.write(new Buffer('my data', 'utf-8'), function(err, bytesWritten) {\n\t\t\t\tif (err) console.log(err);\n\t\t\t});\n\n\t\t\tbtSerial.on('data', function(buffer) {\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(buffer.toString('utf-8'));\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}, function () {\n\t\t\tconsole.log('cannot connect');\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t// close the connection when you're ready\n\t\tbtSerial.close();\n\t}, function() {\n\t\tconsole.log('found nothing');\n\t});\n});\n\nbtSerial.inquire();\n```\n\n## API\n\n### BluetoothSerialPort\n\n#### Event: ('data', buffer)\n\nEmitted when data is read from the serial port connection.\n\n* buffer - the data that was read into a [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) object.\n\n### Event: ('closed')\n\nEmitted when a connection was closed either by the user (i.e. calling `close` or remotely).\n\n#### Event: ('failure', err)\n\nEmitted when reading from the serial port connection results in an error. The connection is closed.\n\n* err - an [Error object](http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/errors/what-is-the-error-object) describing the failure.\n\n#### Event: ('found', address, name)\n\nEmitted when a bluetooth device was found.\n\n* address - the address of the device\n* name - the name of the device (or the address if the name is unavailable)\n\n#### Event: ('finished')\n\nEmitted when the device inquiry execution did finish.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.inquire()\n\nStarts searching for bluetooth devices. When a device is found a 'found' event will be emitted.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.findSerialPortChannel(address, callback[, errorCallback])\n\nChecks if a device has a serial port service running and if it is found it passes the channel id to use for the RFCOMM connection.\n\n* callback(channel) - called when finished looking for a serial port on the device.\n* errorCallback - called the search finished but no serial port channel was found on the device.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.connect(bluetoothAddress, channel[, successCallback, errorCallback])\n\nConnects to a remote bluetooth device.\n\n* bluetoothAddress - the address of the remote Bluetooth device.\n* channel - the channel to connect to.\n* [successCallback] - called when a connection has been established.\n* [errorCallback(err)] - called when the connection attempt results in an error. The parameter is an [Error object](http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/errors/what-is-the-error-object).\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.close()\n\nCloses the connection.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.isOpen()\n\nCheck whether the connection is open or not.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.write(buffer, callback)\n\nWrites a [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) to the serial port connection.\n\n* buffer - the [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) to be written.\n* callback(err, bytesWritten) - is called when the write action has been completed. When the `err` parameter is set an error has occured, in that case `err` is an [Error object](http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/errors/what-is-the-error-object). When `err` is not set the write action was successful and `bytesWritten` contains the amount of bytes that is written to the connection.\n\n#### BluetoothSerialPort.listPairedDevices(callback)\n\n__ONLY ON OSX__\n\nLists the devices that are currently paired with the host.\n\n* callback(pairedDevices) - is called when the paired devices object has been populated. See the [pull request](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port/pull/30) for more information on the `pairedDevices` object.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis module is available under a [FreeBSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause), see the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
